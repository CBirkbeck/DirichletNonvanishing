\section{What this project is about}

We're trying to prove that for a non-trivial Dirichlet character $\chi$, we have $L(\chi, 1 + it) \ne 0$ for all real $t$.

\section{High-level outline}:

\begin{itemize}

\item If $t \ne 0$ or if $\chi^2 \ne 1$ then this follows from the product for $\zeta(s)^3 L(\chi, s)^{-4} L(\chi^2, s)$ which is in \texttt{EulerProducts}. So we may assume that $t = 0$ and $\chi$ is quadratic.

\item Assume for contradiction $L(\chi, 1) = 0$. Then the function
\[ F(s) = L(\chi, s) \zeta(s) \]
is entire.

\item For $\Re(s) > 1$, $F(s)$ is given by a convergent Euler product with local factors XXX. Hence its Dirichlet series coefficients are positive real numbers.

\item Hence the iterated derivatives of $F(s)$ on $(0, \infty)$ alternate in sign.

\item By an analytic result from \texttt{EulerProducts}, this implies that $F(s)$ is real and non-vanishing for all real $s$.


\item However, if $\chi$ is even then $F(0) = 0$, and if $\chi$ is odd then $F(-1) = 0$. This gives the desired contradiction.
\end{itemize}
